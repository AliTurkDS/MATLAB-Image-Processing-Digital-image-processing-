# MATLAB-Image-Processing-Digital-image-processing-
🧾 Overview

This project demonstrates how MATLAB’s Image Processing Toolbox can be used to analyze, enhance, and visualize X-ray CT images.
Key techniques include edge detection, noise reduction, histogram analysis, and 3D visualization using surface and contour plots.

⚙️ Features

Image Enhancement: Noise removal, contrast adjustment, ROI processing.

Transforms: FFT, DCT, and Radon Transform for frequency and spatial analysis.

Visualization:

--Histograms & intensity plots

--3D Surface plots with transparency and lighting

--Contour and ribbon plots for structural mapping

--Filtering Analysis: Used FVTool to inspect magnitude, phase, impulse, and step responses.

🧩 Tools Used

Software: MATLAB 7.0.1

Toolboxes: Image Processing Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox

Techniques: 3D surface plotting, histogram mapping, filter visualization

🧠 Results

Enhanced X-ray CT images with improved edge and contrast clarity.

Generated detailed 3D and contour visualizations for spatial understanding.

Analyzed filter performance through spectral and time-domain plots.

✅ Conclusion

MATLAB provides powerful tools for medical image processing, allowing efficient filtering, visualization, and analysis of CT data for research and diagnostic applications.
